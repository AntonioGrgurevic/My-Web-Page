        <p class="weekndtext">
          Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally
          as The Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter and actor. I started
          listening to him in 2021. At first I liked a couple songs like
          Blinding Lights and Save Your Tears. When I got Covid I was lying in
          my bed and I started listening to entire albums from artists that I
          listened to at that time. And when I got to listen to every album from
          The Weeknd I liked a couple more songs around 2-3 from each album and
          I thought some songs where terrible. But I noticed how diffrent each
          album was from the prevoius one and that caught me off guard because I
          thought that every artist had the same sound and feel to every album.
          I mean thematically every song is either about women and sex or about
          drugs. But the sound was almost completely diffrent in each album and
          thats something that even when I wasn't a fan I appriciated. I also
          loved the stories that he was telling with each song/album. As time
          went on I started liking more of his songs and albums, and now loving
          almost every song and album. Even albums that I hated became one of my
          favourites once I started understanding them and their story. His
          music helped me through the darkest time of my life and helped me keep
          my sanity intact. He is also the only artist whose merchandise I
          bought(I bought a vinyl and a CD).

          Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 - December 8, 2019), known
          professionally as Juice Wrld, was an American rapper and
          singer-songwriter.The first song I heard from him was Lucid Dreams and
          I really liked that song and I still do, but at that time I didn't
          really stick to one artist I was mostly listening to whatever song
          sounded good. About a year later I stumbled on a song called Wishing
          Well. I was pretty deppressed and sad when I first heard that song
          because I didn't really listen to any sad or deppressing music. I also
          found what I thought was a compilation at first called Legends Never
          Die but later I found out that it is acctually an album. It was
          seriously my first time learning what an album is I always thought an
          album was just a random compilation of songs. After Wishing Well
          captivated me I started listening to more songs off the album and I
          really started liking his songs. I also learned of his passing which
          made it really hard listening to his songs. His music thematically is
          about many things some of which are: drugs, deppression, girls, life,
          friends and so on. I've been listening to his music for about 3 years
          now and it helped me through many though times. I'm really sad about
          what happened to him and I hope he finds peace.

          <p class="AfterHourstext">
            After Hours is an 80's inspired album and it is my favourite album
            of all time. As I said before it helped me through a really though
            time in my life and it helped deal with suicidal thoughts I had. The
            album is near perfect in my eyes(because nothing is perfect) and I
            had such a great experience first time listening to this album. I
            can relate to almost every song on the album and I love almost every
            song. To clarify there are no songs that I dislike there are only
            some that I don't love. I love the story and theme with each song
            and I wish that I could listen to it for the first time again. There
            is also a deluxe version which I also love. I also have the vinyl
            version of this album. My favourite songs are: Alone Again, Too
            Late, Heartless, Faith, Blinding Lights, Save Your Tears(it is also
            my favourite song of all time), In Your Eyes, After Hours, Until I
            Bleed Out, Nothing Compares(deluxe) and Final Lullaby(deluxe).

          <p class="DawnFMtext">
            Dawn FM is a 2. part of After Hours so of course I love it. The
            theme and story is purgatory. Dawn FM is a radio station that you
            listen to while travelling purgatory on your way to after life. Dawn
            FM is even more of an 80's album than it's predecessor. I have fond
            memories listening to this album at night under a starry sky and
            while playing League of Legends(LOL). My favourite songs are:
            Gasoline, How Do I Make You Love Me?, Take My Breath, Sacrifice, Out
            Of Time, Is There Someone Else?, Starry Eyes, Don't Break My Heart
            and Less Than Zero.

          <p class="LegendsNeverDietext">
            Legends Never Die is in my humble opinion the best Juice WRLD album.
            The vibe and atmosphere are amazing and feel heavenly. It is the
            first album I ever listened to from front to back and also the first
            album I cried listening to. It has some bad songs that I never
            listen to but there are many songs which I really love. My favourite
            songs are: Conversation, Bad Energy, Righteous, Tell Me U Love Me,
            Life's A Mess, Come & Go (My top 5 favourite of all time), I Want
            It, Wishing Well and Man Of The Year.

          <p class="FightingDemonstext">
            Fighting Demons is a weird album. I love some parts of it but I
            think it should have been made better. There were many problems with
            the label but I won't get in to it. All and all I have good memories
            with this album and it helped me like every Juice album. I love the
            deppressing vibe of the album and it's theme of addiction but my
            main gripe is that some songs are really mediocre and unfinished. My
            favourite songs are: Burn, Already Dead (my top 5 favourite songs
            ever), Cigarettes, Sometimes, Doom, Until The Plug Comes Back
            Around, From My Window, Feel Alone, My Life In A Nutshell, Rich And
            Blind(deluxe) and Legends(deluxe).

          />
          <p class="KissLandtext">
            Kiss Land is also a near perfect album. The story, vibe and
            atmosphere are some of my favourites. The main theme about the album
            is the tour life and how the artist deals with loneliness that comes
            with it. The sound of rain thounder and the sense of heartbreak and
            travelling are unforgettable. My main problem is that the 2 starting
            songs are mediocre compared to the rest of the album. My favourite
            songs are: Adaptation, Love In The Sky, Belong To The World
            (probably my second favourite song of all time), Live For,
            Wanderlust, Kiss Land, Pretty and Tears In The Rain.
